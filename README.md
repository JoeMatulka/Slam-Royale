# Slam-Royale
Code used to create game Slam Royale

You'll notice that some of the code references prefabs, textures, sounds, etc. I stripped those out.

Additionally, some of the code used third party plugins like Google's Admob and some Unity specifc stuff for inputs.

Feel free to use whatever you want, hopefully it can help!

Happy creating!
